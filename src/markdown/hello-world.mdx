# Hello World

This is my first blog post using **MDX**!

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, like interactive charts or notifications, and embed them within your content.

```js
function greet() {
  return 'Hello world!';
}
```

You can even use React components within your markdown!
